Docker Hub announced they are going to start purging images, via their new [retention policy](https://www.docker.com/pricing/retentionfaq). 
This is obviously terrible for scientific repodocibility.
This is a simple test to parse container names in [repos.txt](repos.txt) and pull them on a monthly basis.
